    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyze the biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particulary around various species in different national parks and locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is intended to scope, analyze, prepare and plot data, and seek to explain the findings from this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some questions that this project seeks to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for animal species?\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Which species were spotted the most and ther distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sources:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`observations.csv` and `species_info.csv` were provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com) learning platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real world data, but is mostly fictional."

    "## Scoping the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Four sections were created below to help guide the project's process and progress. The first section is *Project Goals*, this section will define the objectives and set the intentions for this project. The next section is the *Data* (data is already provided but still needs to be checked if it can meet the project goals). Thirdly, the *Analysis*, which includes the methods and questions that align with the project goals. Lastly, *Evaluation* will help us make conclusions and findings from our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project the perspective will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, the main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and those species and their relationship to the national parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has two data sets that came with the package. The first `csv` file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distributions\n",
    "1. Counts\n",
    "1. Relationship between species\n",
    "1. Conservation status of species\n",
    "1. Observations of species in parks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Revisiting the goals and checking if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (the goals section). This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered."

    "The project was able to make several data visualizations and inferences about the various species in four of the National Parks this dataset was made of.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions first posted in the beginning were answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for animal species?\n",
    "    - The vast majority of species were not part of conservation.(`5,633` vs `191`)\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "    - `Mammals` and `Birds` had the highest percentage of being in protection.\n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "    - the study found that `bats` occurred the most number of times and they were most likely to be found in Yellowstone National Park."

    "This dataset only included observations from the last 7 days which prohibits analyze changes over time. It would be curious to see how the conservation status for various species changes over time. Also, what is missing is the Area of each park, it can be assumed that Yellowstone National Park might be much larger than the other parks which would mean that it would exhibit more observations and greater biodiversity."
